# 🌊 Phase 1: Requirement Analysis

## 1. Project Overview
Briefly describe the "Workflow" project.

## 2. User Requirements
- What are the main pain points you are solving?

example:
## 3. Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Priority |
| FR-01 | Add a new task | High |
| FR-02 | Delete a task | Medium |
| FR-03 | Set a recurring reminder | Low |

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Usability:** Simple UI with dark mode support.
- **Reliability:** No data loss during unexpected crashes.

## 5. Requirement Traceability Matrix (Intro)
(This will be an empty table you'll fill later to ensure every feature matches a requirement).
