1. High-Level Design (HLD)
This focuses on the "Big Picture." You decide how the system will be structured as a whole.
System Architecture: Choosing between styles like Monolithic, Microservices, or Client-Server.
Module Definition: Identifying the main parts of the app (e.g., User Auth, Task Engine, Notification Service).
Technology Stack: Finalizing the languages and tools (e.g., Python, PostgreSQL, React).

2. Low-Level Design (LLD)
This is the "Granular Detail." It focuses on the internal logic of each module.
Database Schema: Designing table structures, keys, and relationships.
Class Diagrams: Defining the objects, their attributes, and how they interact.
API Specs: Detailing the inputs and outputs for every function or endpoint.



📝 What do you actually DO in this phase?
Create a Data Model: Decide exactly what a "Task" looks like in your database.
Map the Logic: Use flowcharts to show how a user moves from "Login" to "Task Completed."
Design the UI: Create wireframes or mockups of every screen so you don't have to "guess" the layout while coding.
Define Security: Decide how you will protect your data (e.g., encryption methods or login protocols).
