# 🌊 Phase 3: Implementation

## 1. Development Environment
- **OS:** Windows 11 (PowerShell)
- **IDE:** VS Code
- **Language Version:** [e.g., Node.js v20]

example:
## 2. Progress Tracker (Unit Breakdown)
- [ ] **Module 1: Database Setup** - Status: Completed
- [ ] **Module 2: Task Logic** - Status: In Progress
- [ ] **Module 3: UI Components** - Status: Pending

## 3. Deviations from Design
*Waterfall strictly discourages changes, but if you absolutely MUST change something, document it here:*
- **Change:** Switched from UUID to Auto-increment ID.
- **Reason:** Simplifies local storage for Version 1.0.






✅ When is this phase "Done"?
Implementation is finished when:
All code is written.
The code compiles/runs without major crashes.
Each individual part (unit) has been checked.
